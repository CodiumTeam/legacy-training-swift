# Gilded Rose Golden master

## Description:
This kata has a legacy code to practice writing a Golden Master piece.

Write your code inside the Sources/Main/main.swift

# Business requirements
You don't need the business requirements.

## Goals:
- Write a code to generate an output that you need to be sure the code behaviour does not change.
- Write an script to automate the test execution.

## Run the tests

**Locally** on Linux and Mac

    make run

or inside **docker** on **Linux and Mac**

    make docker-run
